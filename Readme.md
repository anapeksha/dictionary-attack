# Dictionary Attack

## What is a dictionary attack?
In cyber security  a dictionary attack is a form of brute force attack technique for defeating a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase by trying thousands or millions of likely possibilities, such as words in a dictionary or previously used passwords, often from lists obtained from past security breaches. 

## How to perform a dictionary attack?
A dictionary attack is based on trying all the strings in a pre-arranged listing. Such attacks originally used words one would find in a dictionary (hence the phrase dictionary attack),[1] however there are now much larger lists available on the open Internet that contain hundreds of millions of passwords recovered from past data breaches.
